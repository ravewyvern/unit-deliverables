# Unit 1 Programming Project #
## Goal: ##
_Create a Java program using Unit 1 topics to demonstrate knowledge and mastery._

You may work in groups of up to 3, note the requirements change slightly (see rubric below).

You will not need the [ClassDefinition.java](../ClassDefinition.java) or the [UtilityBelt.java](../UtilityBelt.java) files for this deliverable. **You may delete them or leave them in place.**

## Requirements/Rubric: ##
1. Your project must use materials from, **and restricted to**, topics we've covered so far:
    - [ ] data/typecasting
    - [ ] basic and formatted output
    - [ ] static methods and parameters
2. Your project must specifically have:
    - [ ] At least 5 data variables, and use of `String`, `int`, and `double`
    - [ ] At least 2 distinct static method definitions *per group member* used in your program in a useful way (make sure to `//comment` which group member created each method)
    - [ ] A demonstration of some sort of calculation or transformation of data
    - [ ] Formatted output used in a meaningful way to the real-world topic
