# Unit 2 Programming Project #
## Goal: ##
_Create a Java program using Unit 2 topics to demonstrate knowledge and mastery._

You will not need the [ClassDefinition.java](../ClassDefinition.java) file for this deliverable. **You may delete it or leave it in place.**

## Requirements: ##
2. Your project must use materials from, **and restricted to**, topics we've covered so far in a useful way. Specifically: 
    - [ ] Must include at least one array (either single or multi-dimensional array is fine)
    - [ ] Must include conditional (if/else, switch) statements
    - [ ] Must include at least one loop (while, for, or do-while are all fine)
    - [ ] You may use the `UtilityBelt` class (provided) to collect user input following examples shown in labs
    - [ ] You may also use anything we've learned so far from Unit 1, such as variables, static methods, etc.
