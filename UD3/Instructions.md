# Unit 3 Programming Project #
## Goal: ##
_Create a Java program using Unit 3 topics to demonstrate knowledge and mastery of object oriented programming._
## Requirements: ##
Your project must use materials from, and restricted to, topics we've covered so far. Specifically: 
- [ ] Must include at least 1 programmer-defined class for each group member, in addition to the `Main` class.
  - [ ] each class definition must have **at least** 3 instance variables representing two or more datatypes (`String`, `int`, `double`, `char`, `boolean`).
  - [ ] each class definition must have **all** of our required methods for encapsulation:
	- [ ] default constructor method
	- [ ] full constructor method
	- [ ] accesssor/getter and mutator/setter methods for each instance variable
	- [ ] `setAll` method
	- [ ] `toString` method
	- [ ] `equals` method
  - [ ] you *may* add any additional methods, static or non-static, that are useful to your project, the above is just the mininum
- [ ] Must have a driver class (`Main`) that illustrates the use of each programmer-defined class type.
- [ ] You may use `UtilityBelt` (provided) or create a `Scanner` object to collect user input (you can use the Labs as examples of some possibilities)
- [ ] You may also use anything we've learned so far from Unit 1 or Unit 2.
