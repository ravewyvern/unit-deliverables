# Unit Deliverable Overview
At the end of each unit (about every four topics) you will be asked to demonstrate your understanding of that unitâ€™s content by completing a project incorporating all of the topics from the unit.

## Instructions
All unit deliverables must be tied it to a real-world topic. Replace the `README.md` file with an explanation of your real-world topic:
- Should be linked to an article, podcast, video, etc. ***OR***
- A personal idea for something that is useful/fun for you, your community, etc.
## Requirements
Each unit deliverable has its own requirements to demonstrate the learning from that unit. Please reference the document below for the speicfic unit deliverable you will be working on.

- [Unit 1](.instructions/Deliverable%201.md)
- [Unit 2](.instructions/Deliverable%202.md)
- [Unit 3](.instructions/Deliverable%203.md)

In addition, all Unit Deliverables are required to have a [README](README.md) file that describes their project. It must include:
- [ ] At least two different sized headers
- [ ] At least one link to an outside resource
- [ ] An ordered or unordered list
- [ ] Text styling (e.g. strong, emphasized)
- [ ] Optionally consider demonstrating the use of a Markdown table.

## Resources: 
- OLI Modules + Lecture Videos - for examples, Java syntax rules, and strategy
- Labs - larger examples, getting inspiration for ideas or upgrade a lab you found interesting.
- You are allowed to expand on your Unit 1 or Unit 2 Programming Project as well! 
- ([Markdown Cheatsheet](https://www.markdownguide.org/cheat-sheet/))
## Scoring Guide (EARN Scale): 
All group members might not recieve the same score. Be sure to indicate which parts of the project you contributed. You may also be asked to explain portions of the code so that I can distinguish your personal understanding of the material.

- **Exemplary** (***E***): Everything for A, plus code is well-documented and follows all course style conventions. This work could be used as a classroom example.
- **Acceptable** (***A***): Understanding of the concepts is evident. Code compiles and runs without errors. All of the requirements are met.
- **Revision Needed** (***R***): Partial understanding of the concepts is evident, but there are significant gaps. Further review and improvements required. Program does not run or not all requirements are met.
- **Not Assessable** (***N***): Not enough information is present in the work to determine whether there is understanding of the concepts.
